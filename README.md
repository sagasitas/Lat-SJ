## Progress

We have done with the prototyping using medium basket with some corrections
Our next plan is to making the artificial environmental using artificial pond and renew the propeller and another materials such as the sensors. Our first step is making the propeller work semi-automatic which can controlled with software in PC. Second step is making the sensor such pH sensor and temperature sensor completed with the output. 
We also will build the pond environment (design attached) completed with water pump in order to make the water rotate around the pipe in order to filter and control the water condition.
